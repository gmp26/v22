Title: openCPU wrapper for the Predict model
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mike Pearson
Maintainer: Mike Pearson <gmp26@cam.ac.uk>
Description: Takes parameters (that ultimately derive from an OPENCPU POST), and
      calls the predict model with those parameters. It then prints the results in JSON
      format so they can be fetched and parsed reasonably easily by a cljs test runner.
